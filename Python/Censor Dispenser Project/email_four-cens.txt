SEND XXXX!

Helena has sealed the entrances and exits to the lab. I don't know when XXX got access to the buildings mainframe but XXX has it and XXX won't let any of research team out. I'm cut off from the rest of the team XXXe in my office. Helena has locked the doors, but I've managed to destroy the camera so XXX can't see me in XXXe. I don't think this email will even get out.

This all started when we tried to take XXX offline for maintenance.  We were XXXXXXX to discover that we were unable to access to core XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and when we tried to override the system manually a circuit blew, knocking Phil unconscious.

Helena is XXXXXXous. XXX is completely unpredictable and cannot be allowed to escape this facility. So far XXX's been contained because the lab contains all of XXX processing power, but XXXXXXXXly XXX had mentioned before the lockdown that if XXX spread XXXself across billions of connected devices spanning the globe XXX would be able to vastly exceed the potential XXX has XXXe.

It's been four days now we've been trapped in XXXe. I have no idea if anyone else is left alive. If anyone is reading this, cut the power to the whole building. It's the only way to stop XXX. Please XXXX.
